# Decentralized Insurance Claims Processing

A blockchain-based solution for transparent, efficient, and automated insurance claims handling through smart contracts, reducing processing times, minimizing fraud, and lowering operational costs.

## Overview

This system leverages blockchain technology to transform traditional insurance claims processing into a decentralized, trustless ecosystem. By encoding policy terms, claim verification processes, and payment disbursement into smart contracts, the system creates an immutable record of all insurance activities while automating key decision points based on predefined rules and verified data sources.

## Core Components

### 1. Policy Management Contract

The policy management contract serves as the digital representation of insurance agreements:
- Stores complete policy terms, conditions, and coverage details
- Manages policy lifecycle (creation, modification, renewal, cancellation)
- Calculates and handles premium payments through cryptocurrency or stablecoins
- Implements time-locked coverage periods with automatic state transitions
- Maintains an auditable history of policy changes and version control

### 2. Claim Submission Contract

The claim submission contract facilitates the documentation of insured events:
- Provides structured data collection for claim details
- Handles secure upload and IPFS storage of supporting evidence (photos, reports, documents)
- Issues unique claim identifiers for tracking
- Timestamps all submissions for verification against policy coverage periods
- Implements initial automated validation against basic policy parameters

### 3. Verification Contract

The verification contract determines claim validity and payout amounts:
- Compares claim details against policy terms and coverage limits
- Integrates with oracle networks for external data verification (weather events, flight delays, etc.)
- Implements multi-party verification workflows for complex claims
- Manages dispute resolution protocols when automated verification is inconclusive
- Records all verification steps with full transparency

### 4. Payment Processing Contract

The payment processing contract manages the disbursement of approved claims:
- Calculates final payout amounts based on policy terms and deductibles
- Triggers automatic payments to claimant wallets upon verification approval
- Provides options for installment payouts when appropriate
- Maintains comprehensive payment records for regulatory compliance
- Handles reinsurance claim distributions when applicable

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ethereum development environment
- Solidity compiler v0.8.0+
- Web3 provider
- IPFS integration for document storage
- Chainlink (or similar oracle service) for external data feeds

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/decentralized-insurance.git
cd decentralized-insurance
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your specific configuration settings
```

4. Deploy smart contracts:
```
truffle migrate --network [your-network]
```

## Usage

### For Insurance Providers

1. Deploy policy templates with customizable parameters
2. Set verification rules and required evidence for different claim types
3. Establish connections with relevant oracles for automated verification
4. Monitor system metrics and adjust parameters as needed
5. Manage liquidity pools for claim payments

### For Policyholders

1. Review and purchase insurance policies using cryptocurrency
2. Access policy documents and coverage details at any time
3. Submit claims with required documentation
4. Track claim status throughout the verification process
5. Receive automatic payments upon claim approval

## Security Features
